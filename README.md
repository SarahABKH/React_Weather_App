## Features

- Real-time weather data retrieval using a weather API.
- Display of current temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
- Search functionality to find weather information for different locations.
- Clean and intuitive user interface built with React.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the weather app on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) must be installed on your machine. You can download and install them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-weather-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd react-weather-app
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

Before you can use the app, you need to obtain an API key from a weather data provider. This app is set up to work with [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/), but you can use any other weather API as well.

1. Sign up for a free OpenWeatherMap account to obtain an API key: [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api).

2. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add your API key:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Make sure to replace `your-api-key` with the actual API key you obtained.

### Usage

Now that you have installed the app and configured the API key, you can start using it.

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

3. Enter a location in the search bar and press Enter or click the Search button to fetch the weather data for that location.

4. The app will display the current temperature, wind speed, and humidity for the specified location.

### Dependencies

The weather app relies on the following dependencies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/): A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- Other dependencies can be found in the `package.json` file.
